0.1 --- Initial Release May 24, 2015

* updating of the midi track name, after becoming a logical track whenever events exist, 
  doesnt work. Once you export and give it a name, though, it will be part of the patch.

* exporting more than one midifile will cause a crash in the midifile library. UNRESOLVED

* autogen.sh complains about missing files, suggests foreign option.

* configure.ac in rtaudio has been hack to only use --with-alsa and --with-jack for linux,
a better approach is to pass these options from top level configure.
