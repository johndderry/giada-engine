KNOWN ISSUES

-- Initial Release May 24, 2015

* updating of the midi track name, after events exist, doesn't occur on the screen.
You will see the correct name assigned when you go to export the file.

* exporting more than one midifile will cause a crash in the midifile library.

* autogen.sh complains about missing files, suggests foreign option.

* configure.ac in rtaudio has been hack to only use --with-alsa and --with-linux for linux,
a better approach is to pass these options from top level configure.
