    <h2>Building GiadaEngine from the Github Repository<br>
    </h2>
    <p>These are the instructions for Linux. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Download the zip file from the github repository. You'll need the
      c++ compiler, jack and fltk development libraries available.
      GiadaEngine has the RtAudio, RtMidi and MidiFile libraries as
      internal libraries for ease of building.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Basically, do these steps:<br>
    </p>
    <p>$ unzip giada-engine-master.zip<br>
      $ cd giada-engine-master<br>
      giada-engine-master$ ./autogen.sh<br>
      giada-engine-master$ ./configure --target=linux<br>
      giada-engine-master$ make<br>
    </p>
    <p>This should make two binaries, the engine in console mode (
      ./engine/gdEngine ) and the fltk interface (
      ./interfaces/fltk/giada ). The fltk giada binary is the one we are
      concerned with here.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Setting Up GiadaEngine</h2>
    <p>Starting Giada for the first time it should complain about an
      invalid configuration and start with defaults. It may also say the
      sound card is not configured correctly, but don't worry. You will
      want to go immediately and configure it the program to match your
      installation. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>The <b>config</b> button opens a configuration window with four
      tabs, <b>Sound System</b>, <b>Midi</b>, <b>Behaviors</b>, and <b>Misc</b>.
      Most of the changes you make in the settings of configuration will
      not become active until you exit and restart Giada.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Sound System</h4>
    <p>Primarily, check the settings of System, Output device, Input
      Device, and Record delay compensation here.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>MIDI</h4>
    <p>Check System, Output port, Input port. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Behaviors</h4>
    <p>Controls various behaviors during operation.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Misc</h4>
    <p>You may want to enable debug messages to the console. It says
      standard output, but it's really console standard error.
      GiadaEngine will then display what audio and midi devices it sees
      when starting up.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Setup the alternate click style and midi click. GiadaEngine
      default click style is Giada's original which has a click on each
      beat and one louder click on the downbeat. The alternate style
      places the louder click on the last beat for a fill beat, but then
      (for midi click) adds a downbeat event. Midi click is by default
      off, where the click is created in PCM audio. Enabling it will
      have midi events sent on Channel 10 to use midi instruments. These
      can be reconfigured in the MIDI tab, by default they are using
      General Midi closed Hi-hat, open Hi-hat and Bass drum.<br>
    </p>
    <p>After setting things up, it's important to verify that all the
      setting are correct when you just start up the program. This makes
      sure the engine operates correctly.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Layout of the GiadaEngine Main Window</h2>
    <p>At the top left are four menu buttons:&nbsp; <b>file</b>, <b>edit</b>,
      <b>config</b> and <b>about</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To the right of that are: <b>output meter</b>, <b>input meter</b>,
      <b>output </b><b>level</b> and <b>input level</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Back on the left under the menu buttons are the sequencer
      transport controls: <b>rewind</b>, <b>play</b>, <b>record
        actions</b>, <b>record sample</b>, <b>enable-click</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To the right of that are timing controls: <b>enable-quantify</b>,
      <b>increase tempo</b>, <b>set tempo</b> (which also displays
      tempo), <b>decrease tempo</b>. Then there are two rows. The top
      row has <b>enable</b><b> song advance</b>, <b>manual advance</b>,
      <b>double song sections</b> and <b>halve song sections</b>. The
      bottom row has <b>set-timing</b> (which also displays timing), <b>double
        beats</b> and <b>halve beats</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, centered in the window are two horizontal display bars
      which are the song and meter display bars. The top row of squares
      is the song bar and it show the engine's progress through the song
      sections. The bottom row is the beat bar and it shows the engines
      progress through the beats and measures of one section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Under that are 32 check boxes for opening section windows for
      each possible a song section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Below that are two columns available for adding channels in the
      uni-section of the song, which are for channels that don't belong
      to song section, hence they are called universal. The third column
      has only a button for adding new columns. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Using GiadaEngine</h2>
    <h3>Creating Something from Scratch</h3>
    <p>Here are the basic steps for creating a hybrid sample/midi
      project from scratch. It assumes you have both input and output
      devices for audio and midi available and functioning.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>1. Set Up Some Some Basic Parameters</h4>
    <p>Choose at a minimum the number of beats in you looping samples.
      It defaults to four beats in one measure, shown as 4/1. You can
      have up to 32 beats in any sample. Beyond that, you will use
      sections to add more dynamic features to your loops.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Start the sequencer with play transport control. You will see the
      beats of the sequencer progress on the lower grid of the beat
      meter. Adjust the tempo. Adjust the <b>input level</b>, it will
      be zero on starting. Verify you have input signal. <br>
    </p>
    <p>You're now set to do some sampled looping. You can perform all
      the functioning you need to create analog and midi sample tracks,
      edit them, select when they play back, <i>while the sequence runs</i>.
      You are truly live and action never has to stop! <br>
    </p>
    <h4>2. Create a Sample Channel in the Uni Section</h4>
    <p>Select <b>Add new channe</b><b>l</b><b> :</b> <b>Sample Channel</b>.</p>
    <p>You now have an empty sample channel. The channel display is
      meant to resemble a analog mixer channel, arranged horizontally.
      The left button will activate/play the sample, the next button
      displays sample position, the third larger button will show the
      title and open a menu of channel related operations. The next
      button controls looping and shows a "_" initially. The next button
      "M" enables mute, and "S" enables soloing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now, a sample that you can record can be used in one of two ways:
      It can be played over the beats of the song like a analog channel
      might, or it can be played repeatedly from the beginning like a
      sample from a sampler might. In this discussion, I am assuming use
      as a analog channel might be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To record the sample, use the <b>record sample</b> button from
      the transport control. Immediately the name of the channel will
      change to a logical name, the channel display will turn blue and
      the sample will begin recording. Once enabled, sampling will
      continue even as the beats come to and end the the sample begins
      from the beginning. Sample audio data is being accumulated in the
      channel, it is basically overdubbing onto itself. Therefore it is
      important to only have the channel in record mode and sampling
      only during the period required! Use the <b>record sample</b>
      button again to stop recording of the sample. <br>
    </p>
    <p>By default the sample is set to trigger singly, called
      Oneshot.basic, which you can do with the activate/play button. To
      have the sample played back continually, set to Loop.basic. You
      should be able to hear the sample now.</p>
    <h4>3. Create a Midi Channel in the Uni Section</h4>
    <p>Select <b>Add new channe</b><b>l</b><b> : Midi Channel</b>.</p>
    <p>You now have an empty midi channel. Again, the channel display is
      meant to resemble a analog mixer channel, arranged horizontally.
      The left button will activate/play the sample, the next button
      selects grab-record. The other buttons are the same as for sample
      channel: the third larger button will show the title and open a
      menu of channel related operations. The next button controls
      looping and shows a "_" initially. The next button "M" enables
      mute, and "S" enables soloing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>By default midi channels are set to enable midi event tunneling (
      to capture midi notes ), enable midi output, and go into play mode
      immediately ( for uni channels, which can be re-configured ). In
      this configuration&nbsp; ( as well as any time midi output is
      enabled on any midi channel ) <b>any midi note events on the
        input are immediately echoed to the midi output on the midi
        output channel</b>. If you are using a keyboard, the keyboard
      notes are echoed on the correct channel.<br>
    </p>
    To record the sample, use the <b>record events</b> button from the
    transport control. Recording events means any midi events occurring
    on the midi input channel will be sent to any channels that may want
    to make use of them. We are using the midi channels here in
    midi-tunnel mode, the default, so these events represent midi notes
    and controller events.<br>
    <br>
    Immediately the name of the channel will change to a logical name,
    and the channel display will turn red and the channel will begin
    recording. Like with samples, once enabled, sampling will continue
    even as the beats come to and end the the sample begins from the
    beginning. Midi event data is being accumulated in the channel, it
    is basically overdubbing onto itself. Therefore it is important to
    only have the channel in record mode and sampling&nbsp; only during
    the period required! Use the <b>record events</b> button again to
    stop recording of the sample. <br>
    <br>
    After recording, the midi channel may need to be activated to play.
    With automatic playback of Uni channels enabled, on Uni channels
    that won't be necessary. Channels in specific sections other than
    Uni section will receive their playback enabling when their section
    comes up for play. Other than that, the <b>activate/play</b> button
    toggles between active or not.<br>
    <h4>3. Create Channels in Song Sections Other Than Uni</h4>
    <p>Song Sections are meant to provide the arrangement of the samples
      into a song. There are up to 32 possible sections, and they are
      represented by the rectangles of the top grid. You see them
      progress any time the sequencer is running. The section advances
      to the next one after the sequencer completes all song beats, as
      long as the song advance is enabled. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Initially, all the representational rectangles for each section
      are blank. Clicking on one will begin rotating in through possible
      song sections beginning with Sect <b>A</b>, Sect, <b>B,</b> etc.
      <i>Having a section letter other than blank is giving assignment
        to that section.</i> The possible section names are limited to
      the number of sections in the song (four sections goes up to <b>D</b>).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you've assigned a section label to rectangle in the song
      meter, channels in that Section will be automatically set to play
      when the song enters that Section, and will be automatically
      stopped when the song leaves that section. Uni channels are not
      affected by sections. You have to start Uni channels by hand, with
      the exception being new channels may be set to play automatically.
      See the <b>Behaviors</b> tab of the configuration to control this
      behavior.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To create channels in various Sections, open the window for that
      section by toggling the selector for that window, one of the 32
      check boxes under the song/beat meter. The window will have the
      same two columns for channels and another for creating new
      columns. Create sample and midi channels in the same fashion as
      for Uni channels. <br>
    </p>
    <p>As the song progresses through the sections, each active section
      will have the channels lite up with background colors to indicate
      the state of the channel: pink for active channel, red for midi
      channel in record mode, blue for sample channel in record mode.
      Nonactive channels will be dark.<br>
