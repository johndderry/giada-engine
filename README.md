# giada-engine
Derived from Giada, the Hardcore Loop Machine.

This a restructured source where the sequencer engine has been separated from the fltk interface, to 
allow for additional interfaces. The engine also runs standalone as a console application.

The fltk interface has been expanded from Giada to include musical sections, with each section
in it's own window. Support for midi instrument recording alongside of sampling has been greatly improved.
